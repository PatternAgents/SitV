// Add an "EEPROM" dictionary to Embedis, using the Ardunio EEPROM API
//
// Since the esp8266 platform does not have real EEPROM internal to the device, 
// it is emulated using SPI Flash memory. 
// Use "SET/Write" sparingly to avoid SPI Flash memory wear leveling issues.
//
// We show in this example how to use Embedis to hold configuration settings.
// Due to Wear leveling issues this is not recommended for real-time and changing data.
// Use NVSRAM, FRAM or other suitable storage technology for rapidly changing data sets!
//
// To configure an EEPROM dictionary, call setup_EEPROM from your
// main setup() function. Optionally, supply the database name you want to use.
// e.g. setup_EEPROM();
//      setup_EEPROM( F("MYEEPROM") );
//
// Use the Embedis "select" command to enable your optional database name
// e.g. embedis-> select MYEEPROM
// The Embedis default database is "EEPROM", using the internal EEPROM memory.
// (or in the case of ESP8266 or Arduino Due, Emulated EEPROM...)
//
#include <EEPROM.h>

// Set your particular EEPROM size, which may want to be less than the physical device size.
// As an example, a 16K byte EEPROM might use only the first 4096 bytes to
// hold an IMPI, DeviceTree or other persistant data structure. 
// Since Embedis writes from high memory to low memory, you could use 12K bytes
// of that memory for an Embedis Keystore, coexisting with the other persistant data structure.
// If E2END isn't defined you can uncoment the line below and manually set the size (in bytes).
//
//#define E2END 1023
