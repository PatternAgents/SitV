    Embedis_I2C_FRAM : Embedis example with EEPROM and I2C FRAM Keystores
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------
    This example Arduino IDE sketch works on a number of platforms including AVR & ESP8266
    and provides an Embedis server that store permenant (persistant) data in
    either the internal EEPROM of the processor or an external I2C FRAM,
    or Ferro-Electric Random Access Memory, such as the MB85RC256V or FM24V10 type parts.

    The Embedis server can be used to get/set keys in the EEPROM or FRAM databases,
    and can be used to store project and configuration settings. 
    You no longer need to embed  that "data" into your "program"! 
    The EEPROM & FRAM are persistant memory structures, and can be
    used across multiple projects to configure your program setting for
    the specific hardware and network configuration you are using. 
    
    Now, you don't need to recompile your program and reflash your device
    in order to change the device settings anymore.

    We think that this is a much better mechanism for storing settings between projects.
    Once you start using Embedis for your projects, you'll see how quick and easy
    it is to move and reconfigure your devices without needing to recompile 
    and reflash your device firmware just to change a configuration setting.
    Now settings can be changed "on-the-fly" with just an Embedis Server.
    (some settings changes however, will require a restart/reboot to take effect.)
